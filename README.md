# Machine-Learning
This repository contains Machine Learning based projects
This project aims to predict the Relative Humidity (RH) of a household using a dataset and through below indicated steps.
a) Importing the required modules
b) Reading the dataset and deriving useful time-related features
c) Visualizing And Exploring Dataset
d) Feature engineering/extraction(Defining the required functions for performing the feature selection)
e) Feature Selection using Random Farest algorithm, Linear Regression, and XGboost selection types.
f) choosing the promising model and fit the model for test section.
g) Comparing the driven parameters
h) Comparing the result with the real data.
